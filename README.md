        <h2><span style='font-size:50px;'>&#128679;</span>Roadmap to Future Improvements:</h2>
        <p>I decided to change the colors around from the original exercise, I also decided to keep the background color of each square the same rather than adding a random color. I would like to add something more fun to the winning condition like a sound or an animation. I would also like to create a reset button. </p>
